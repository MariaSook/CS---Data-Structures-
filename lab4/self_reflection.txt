All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: More helper methods to prevent repetition in code

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: all of it. 

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: repetition and random math

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: we all wrote redundant code in some places, and all struggled with resize

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to operly think about resize, I had a method that worked but didnâ€™t perfectly match the spec

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: try to get rid of redundancy

A: I thought my linked list was clear and concise

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I think it was easy to read

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: nothing

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: We all thought it was relatively easy

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: n/a

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Yes, it was interesting to see the staff solutions
