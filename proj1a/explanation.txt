The project took much more work than I anticipated.

In 61a I could finish a project in one day, then project 0 was relatively simple.

It took more time than I thought it would to grasp the concept of a sentinel, and then to start coding.

I also had problems with my java visualizer in Intellij and made very little progress until I fixed my problem.

I really really struggled with resize and the methods add/remove in ArrayDeque.
