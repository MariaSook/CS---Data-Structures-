I had more trouble understanding GraphDB than I expected. Once i understood it it was
relatively easy to fill in and figure out how to structure my graph.

Overall, this was  a challenging project. The math for Rasterer was difficult to
understand, but once I got it, it was not too hard to implement.

I am proud of this project and how relatively quickly I completed it when
I expected it to take far longer.
